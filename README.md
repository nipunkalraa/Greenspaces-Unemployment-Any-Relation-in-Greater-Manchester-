# Greenspaces-Unemployment-Any-Relation-in-Greater-Manchester-
This project analyzes the spatial relationship between green spaces and unemployment rates among non-white populations (ages 16-49) in Greater Manchester, UK. The analysis explores potential environmental justice issues by examining whether areas with higher unemployment rates among ethnic minorities have less access to green spaces.
